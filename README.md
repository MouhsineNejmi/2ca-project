## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MouhsineNejmi/2ca-project
cd 2ca-todo
```

---

### 2. **Backend Setup (Laravel)**

```sh
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Set your DB and Pusher credentials in .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

  - Set `BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher` and your Pusher keys

---

### 3. **Frontend Setup (Vue.js)**

```sh
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Set VITE_API_URL to your backend API (e.g., http://localhost:8000/api)
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 4. **Pusher Setup**

- Create a free account at [pusher.com](https://pusher.com/)
- Create a Channels app and copy your keys to both backend `.env` and frontend `echo` config

---

### 5. **Usage**

- Register a new user
- Login
- Create, edit, delete tasks
- Open the Notifications page to see real-time task creation notifications

## üßë‚Äçüíª Project Structure

```
2ca-todo/
  backend/    # Laravel API
  frontend/   # Vue 3 SPA
```

- **Backend:**

  - `app/Services/` and `app/Repositories/` for SOLID, clean code
  - Events, broadcasting, and JWT auth

- **Frontend:**
  - Pinia for state management
  - shadcn UI for modern interface
  - Echo + Pusher for real-time

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- JWT stored in HttpOnly cookie (not localStorage)
- All task routes protected by `auth:api` middleware
- Users can only access their own tasks

---

## üìù Best Practices

- SOLID principles in backend
- Service and Repository patterns
- Code is commented and organized

---

## üß™ Testing

- Use Postman or curl to test API endpoints
- Use the app UI to test real-time notifications
